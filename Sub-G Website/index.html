            <p>"Just want to give a huge shout out to coach Tyler and Sub-G. The group of individuals he has training at his gym are a great and very respectful. I brought my little sister with me and they all made her feel so comfortable. Especially since it was her first time. We are excited to have such a great place so close to home and look forward to the future training at SUB-G."</p>

            <p>"Coach Tyler provides one of, if not the most welcoming gym atmospheres I've been a part of. His extensive knowledge of the art, and ability to break down techniques in a detailed fashion affords each student a productive learning experience. I myself have learned a great deal in just a few months of joining the Sub-G team and my passion for BJJ has never been stronger. Highly recommend!!"</p>

            <p>"This is a great school! The teacher is very informative. He takes time out for every student and shows genuine intrest. There is MUCH to be learned at this school. New people to the art will not feel intimidated and experienced individuals will find avenues to improve!"</p>
